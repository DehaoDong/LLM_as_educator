        "content": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's an example of how to implement bubble sort in Python:\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\nThis function takes an array as input and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. It works by iterating through the array and comparing adjacent elements. If two elements are in the wrong order, they are swapped. The function then repeats this process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nTo use this function, you can simply call it with an array as an argument, like this:\n```\narr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]\nsorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)\n```\nThis will output the sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
