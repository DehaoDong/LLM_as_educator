Here is a Python script that implements the bubble sort algorithm:\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\nThis script takes an array as input and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. The `bubble_sort` function first calculates the length of the array and then iterates over the array using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the array from the first element to the second-to-last element, while the inner loop iterates over the array from the second element to the last element.\n\nInside the inner loop, the function checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If the current element is greater than the next element, the function swaps the two elements. This process continues until the inner loop completes, and the outer loop moves on to the next element.\n\nAfter the outer loop completes, the function returns the sorted array.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `bubble_sort` function:\n```\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6, 4]\narr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(arr)\n```\nThis code will output the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`.\n\nIt's worth noting that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large datasets. Other algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort are generally faster and more efficient. However, bubble sort is still useful for small datasets or for educational purposes."

The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The outer loop continues until the entire array has been sorted. The function returns the sorted array.\n\nTo use this script, you can call it with an array as an argument, like this:\n```\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6, 4]\narr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(arr)\n```\nThis will output the sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`."

        "content": "  Sure, here is an example of a Python script that implements bubble sort:\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\nThis script takes an array as input and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. The `bubble_sort` function first calculates the length of the array and then iterates through the array using two nested loops. The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The outer loop continues until the entire array has been sorted. The function returns the sorted array.\n\nTo use this script, you can call it with an array as an argument, like this:\n```\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6, 4]\narr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(arr)\n```\nThis will output the sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`."
