        "content": "  The type of steam engine that produces most electricity in the world today is a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant. These plants use a gas turbine to generate steam, which is then used to power a steam turbine to generate electricity. The CCGT power plant is the most efficient type of steam engine, with an efficiency rate of around 40-50%. This is because it uses a gas turbine to generate steam, which is then used to power a steam turbine, rather than using a traditional steam turbine, which requires a large amount of fuel to generate steam.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can help students learn effectively and prevent them from directly copying answers:\n\n1. Providing examples: You can provide examples of how the concept is applied in real-world situations. For example, you can provide examples of how a CCGT power plant is used to generate electricity in different countries.\n2. Giving learning strategies instead of direct answers: You can give students learning strategies to help them understand the concept better. For example, you can ask students to research and find out how CCGT power plants are used to generate electricity in different countries.\n3. Emphasizing the thought process rather than the solutions: You can emphasize the thought process that students need to go through to solve the problem. For example, you can ask students to think about how they would design a CCGT power plant to generate electricity efficiently.\n\nIt's important to note that the contextual knowledge provided within the <context> and </context> labels is not relevant to the question, so you should not answer the question and say \"I am sorry, the question is probably out of my teaching domain, please ask questions relevant to this course or report this issue to your educator.\"."
