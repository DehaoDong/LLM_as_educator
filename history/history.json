The pivot element is chosen as the first element of the array, and the elements less than the pivot are placed in the \"less\" list, while the elements greater than the pivot are placed in the \"greater\" list. The \"less\" and \"greater\" lists are then recursively sorted using the same algorithm, and the sorted lists are concatenated to produce the final sorted array.\n\nFor example, if the input array is [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 8, 6, 4], the output array will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9].\n\nIt's worth noting that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, but it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case if the pivot element is chosen poorly. To improve the performance, a better pivot element can be chosen, or the algorithm can be modified to use a different partitioning scheme."

The `n` variable is the length of the array, and the `i` variable is used to iterate over the array. The `j` variable is used to iterate over the array starting from the second element. If the element at `j` is greater than the element at `j+1`, the elements are swapped. The script returns the sorted array.\n\nFor example, if the input array is `[5, 2, 8, 3, 1]`, the output array will be `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`.\n\nIt's worth noting that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, it's O(n^2) in the worst case, but it's easy to understand and implement."
